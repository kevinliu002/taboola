# README
This contains the coding challenge for the software internship position at Taboola. 
Files are in the ./src directory.
Java: Built using Intellij IDE. SQL: Following SQLite conventions


#Problem 1: ./src/IntegerString.java
Write a Java program that take a string input and convert it to an integer without 
using the build-in parse function. Example: input value “123”, convert it to an integer type with value 123 

#Problem 2: ./src/IntegerDetect.java
Write a Java program that take a input and detect whether there’s integer in 
there. Example: input value “45222” return true, input value “This Is A Test4me” return true, input value “IAMGOOD” return false 

#Problem 3: ./src/problem3.sql
Please design two new tables to store information about: 
a. products b. product price history The product tables should include the name and category of the product. The product price history table should refer to the product table and should include the price information of products and the start date and/or end date for the product. The current price of a product will have no end date. Please list the table creation scripts for these two tables and a sample query to join two tables together.
